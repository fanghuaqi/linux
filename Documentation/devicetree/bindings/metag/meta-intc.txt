* Meta External Trigger Controller Binding

This binding specifies what properties must be available in the device tree
representation of a Meta external trigger controller.

Required properties:

    - compatible: Specifies the compatibility list for the interrupt controller.
      The type shall be <string> and the value shall include "img,meta-intc".

    - num-banks: Specifies the number of interrupt banks (each of which can
      handle 32 interrupt sources).

    - interrupt-controller: The presence of this property identifies the node
      as an interupt controller. No property value shall be defined.

    - #interrupt-cells: Specifies the number of cells needed to encode an
      interrupt source. The type shall be a <u32> and the value shall be 2.

    - #address-cells: Specifies the number of cells needed to encode an
      address. The type shall be <u32> and the value shall be 0. As such,
      'interrupt-map' nodes do not have to specify a parent unit address.

Optional properties:

    - no-mask: The controller doesn't have any mask registers.

    - default-level: List of default level bitfields, one for each bank, where
      each set bit indicates that the interrupt should be level sensitive by
      default rather than edge. The purpose of this is mainly to ease the
      transition to device tree from platform data. It should not be necessary
      if all IRQ users are configured with devicetree as each one should set the
      flow type in the interrupt specifier.

* Interrupt Specifier Definition

  Interrupt specifiers consists of 2 cells encoded as follows:

    - <1st-cell>: The interrupt-number that identifies the interrupt source.

    - <2nd-cell>: The Linux interrupt flags containing level-sense information,
                  encoded as follows:
                    1 = edge triggered
                    4 = level-sensitive

* Examples

Example 1:

	/*
	 * Meta external trigger block
	 */
	intc: intc {
		// This is an interrupt controller node.
		interrupt-controller;

		// No address cells so that 'interrupt-map' nodes which
		// reference this interrupt controller node do not need a parent
		// address specifier.
		#address-cells = <0>;

		// Two cells to encode interrupt sources.
		#interrupt-cells = <2>;

		// Number of interrupt banks
		num-banks = <2>;

		// IRQs 0-35 are level sensitive, except 16 and 34
		default-level = <0xfffeffff 0xb>;

		// No HWMASKEXT is available (specify on Chorus2 and Comet ES1)
		no-mask;

		// Compatible with Meta hardware trigger block.
		compatible = "img,meta-intc";
	};

Example 2:

	/*
	 * An interrupt generating device that is wired to a Meta external
	 * trigger block.
	 */
	uart1: uart@0x02004c00 {
		// Interrupt source '5' that is level-sensitive.
		// Note that there are only two cells as specified in the
		// interrupt parent's '#interrupt-cells' property.
		interrupts = <5 4 /* level */>;

		// The interrupt controller that this device is wired to.
		interrupt-parent = <&intc>;
	};
